# RewriteEngine On

# The following rule tells Apache that if the requested filename
# exists, simply serve it.

# RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -s [OR]
# RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -l [OR]
# RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -d
# RewriteRule ^.*$ - [L]

# The following rewrites all other queries to index.php. The
# condition ensures that if you are using Apache aliases to do
# mass virtual hosting or installed the project in a subdirectory,
# the base path will be prepended to allow proper resolution of
# the index.php file; it will work in non-aliased environments
# as well, providing a safe, one-size fits all solution.

# RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI}::$1 ^(/.+)/(.*)::\2$
# RewriteRule ^(.*) - [E=BASE:%1]
# RewriteRule ^(.*)$ %{ENV:BASE}/index.php [L]
